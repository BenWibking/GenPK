==GenPK==

This is GenPK, a program to calculate the 3D matter power spectrum. 

To build, first download and build GadgetReader from the same location you got this file. 
Ideally, GadgetReader  should be in ../GadgetReader. Change the first line of the Makefile 
if this is not so. 

Make sure FFTW is installed on your system and that the headers are in your PATH.

To build, type:

make

For the test suite (requires Boost::Test > 1.34), do: 

make test

To run, do:

 ./gen-pk -i filename -o outputdir

filename can be any Gadget snapshot, with or without the .o, in format I or II.

For the doxygen-generated documentation, do:

make doc

To delete compiler output:

make clean

Further documentation may be found in the doxygen generated files in doc/html/index.html
(type "make doc" to make this file), by typing ./gen-pk --help or in gen-pk.cpp
